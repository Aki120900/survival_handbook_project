## Development Process & Tools Used  

### 1️⃣ Visual Creation  
#### AI Tools Explored:  
- **DALL·E** – Used for generating individual images, later refined manually.  
- **Dashtoon & Mage.space** – Tested but did not meet stylistic and artistic requirements.  

#### Final Approach:  
- **DALL·E** was used for initial imagery.  
- **Procreate** was used to enhance character consistency, backgrounds, and expressive details.  

### 2️⃣ Character & Background Design  
- **Expressive characters** with detailed body language for immersive storytelling.  
- **Natural backgrounds** designed to enhance realism while maintaining the manga aesthetic.  
- **Community feedback** (from *7 Seeds* fans) helped refine shading, expressions, and composition.  

### 3️⃣ Game Development & Interaction Design  
- **JigsawPlanet** – Reinforced survival concepts through interactive puzzles.  
- **Puzzel.org** – Created crosswords and word searches to test survival knowledge.  
- **Wordwall** – Developed matching games and quizzes linked to real-life survival skills.  
- **Educaplay** – Designed scenario-based decision-making games to test problem-solving skills.  
- **Accessibility Focus** – The **black-and-white** design ensures readability for color-blind users.  

### 4️⃣ QR Code Integration  
- **Python-generated QR codes** seamlessly connect each chapter to relevant mini-games.
